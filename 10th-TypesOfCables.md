## Unshilded Twisted Pair
```txt
here 10 Base T means
10 means=10MBPS (10mb data ca be send per second)

Transmission(Base Band,Broadband)
Base=at a single time only one signal can be passed.
ex: at a same time if sender send a data, reciever cannt send at hat time 

Broadband= multiple signal at same instance


T=100m 
```
#### Signal can move 100 m here after that signal becomes low it's called Attentuation

## Coaxial Cable:
```txt
All are same
10 base 2 , here 2 means = 200 meter after that attentuaion occurs
```

## Fiber Optic:
```txt
FX=fiber channel , distance upto approax 2km
```

## Facts:
- for n devices max collission= n
- Cables are pure hardware so it worked only in **Physical Layer**
