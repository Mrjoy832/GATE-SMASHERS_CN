# Bridges in CN:
- used to connect **2 LAN**, suppose in one side of bridge is connected with Ring and other may be connected with Bus 
- it worked in Physical and Datalink layer(so it can read MAC addrss so can work forwarding at a particular node)

``` Suppose M1 wants to send to M6 so it will be send by a packet containing
Source Mac and destination MAC
```

- MAC adress be checked by Bridges then forwarding occurs
This Checks done by - **Static** and **Dynamic**

### Static:
done using a table(MAC,PORT)

By checking MAC if in same port -> **Not forwarding** else forwad to next port to the destination.



## Dynamic
- start with empty table

# DO LATERðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥
