No effect in colission as it only ampilfy the signal strength
no effect in broadcast as suppose any node send a signal it will be send to all


## HUB

- collision can occur for same side signals suppose when A,C send signals at same time but not from
different side suppose when A,C send at same time for **Store and forward** Technique.
**So reduces Collision**

- Broadcast no change as signlas reaches to all

## SWITCH:
- All same as **Bridge** just it's muliple port device but bridge is 2 port device

## Router:

Signlas can reach to all devices of sam network but cannt cross the router and reach to other Network so Broadcast also Chnaged
