- can check MAC and IP both
- forwarding possible between different networks by Router using Routing table
- if router cannt find out righ direcion to send signals **Flooding** occurs i.e sending data in all direction
- can do filtering 
- Collission cannt be done in the **Router** as it use **Store and forward** method as when second packet arrived at same time it will be stored in memory then decided where to go

- router has not it's own IP, Left Port's IP will be taken from any IP of Left Network, same for right
